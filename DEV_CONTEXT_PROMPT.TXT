We are building a modular File Cataloger application in Python using PySide6 (Qt).

Architecture principles:
- Clean separation of UI, application, infrastructure.
- Small functions.
- No tight coupling.
- Console logging only.
- JSON config.
- JSON move history (currently in-memory only).
- Preview system using handler registry pattern.
- Each handler has: can_handle(path), load(path).
- Fallback Hex handler exists.
- ZIP handler implemented.
- Media handler implemented using QMediaPlayer.
- FileMover encapsulates shutil.move.
- Undo uses MoveHistory (dict structure { "from": ..., "to": ... }).
- UI split panel: left file list, right preview.
- Directory label fixed above splitter.
- Keyboard navigation implemented.
- F6 moves file.
- Ctrl+Z triggers undo.
- Conflict resolver dialog exists.

Current status:
- Everything working.
- MoveHistory currently in-memory only.
- Architecture stable.
- We want to continue expanding features cleanly.

Continue from this architecture without breaking modularity.
